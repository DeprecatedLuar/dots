{"display":"how hard is this safety system? also does it check if the file already exists in the destination folder? for example there is a difference in files wwith the same name and files that already exist like\n\nYou run the command once and the command moves, let's say 30 files and all maybe 300 files into the destination folder and you stop it. You literally cancel it. It stops doing the conversions and then you do the same conversion again using the same folder as the destination. Now what I'm wondering is, is using the same folder as the destination going to skip what is already in there? Because let's say that we already converted those 300 files. We don't want to convert everything again. Also, we have the system that copies every file that is not an image with our sync and moves to the destination. But the thing is what if the destination already has those files? I think our sink takes care of that correct? Now, let's say that we have in the source folders two files. One is a PNG, the other one is a JPEG, but they have the exact same name besides the extension. This is a situation where one of the two files should have the (1) and the other not because they are true separate files. But what I'm wondering is, this our system respect files that have already been processed. Like it checks the source folder if the file rate exists, it gets skipped. Should we check the metadata though? Just to confirm that, should we compare the metadata of the source and the metadata of this nation, since we are keeping timestamps. And if the metadata is different... It creates the (1) copy If the metadata is identical, it just skip the file.

It's like hard failure Alright, so then we have the colors with this is just variable definition correct Then we have some things that I am kind of confusing are those calling functions like calling an error function calling a success function or are those actual functions that can be called if soon those are functions right So echo, hyphen E. I don't actually know what is hyphen E, but I'm going to assume is for adding colors. Then it says little arrow. Then it takes the first argument, right? The dollar sign number is the arguments from the bash itself correct. So arguments no color. and then it states, drater and then, and sign. 2x1 I don't know what that means. I don't know what is deep. is the commercial E, commercial N, and the Q, and then the exit one, I have no idea what's that. And the other ones are just printing statements, regular ones correct.

The dot files path but is looking specifically for the dot yet correct So I'd say this only checks if it is our repository is it so? Is this more like a safety mechanism? But there's also OR error.
