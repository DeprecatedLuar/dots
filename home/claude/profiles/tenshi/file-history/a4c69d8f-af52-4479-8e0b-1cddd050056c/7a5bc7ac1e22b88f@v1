# Implementation Plan

<!-- WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE:
- This file contains active phases for implementation (completed phases moved to implementation-history.md)
- Each phase = one focused session until stable git commit, follow top-to-bottom order
- SPLIT complex phases into subphases for safety, testing, and incremental value
- Avoid verbose explanations - just implement what's specified and valuable
- Focus on actionable steps: "Update file X, add function Y"
- Success criteria must be testable
- Test after each (sub)phase completion
-->

# Current Status

Better-Curl (Saul) has achieved feature-complete status with comprehensive HTTP client functionality including:

- ✅ **Core HTTP Client**: Full request/response handling with variable substitution
- ✅ **Workspace Management**: TOML-based preset system with 5-file structure
- ✅ **Advanced Editing**: Field-level and container-level editing capabilities
- ✅ **Response Processing**: Filtering, formatting, and history management
- ✅ **Flag System**: Complete flag ecosystem (--raw, --dry-run, -v, --body-only, etc.)
- ✅ **Unix Integration**: System command delegation and composable output

## Future Development

New features should be implemented as new phases in this file following the established patterns:
- Single-focused sessions
- Testable success criteria
- Zero-regression requirement
- Documentation in implementation-history.md upon completion
